# 1. Enable Automatic Software Updates

One of the most imported things to keeps your relay secure is to install security updates timely and ideally automatically so you can not forget about it. Follow the instructions to enable [automatic software updates](updates) for your operating system.

# 2. Enable the EPEL repository

To install `tor` package on CentOS/RHEL, you need to install the [EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) repository first:

`yum install epel-release`

# 3. Install the `tor` package and verify the EPEL signing key

`yum install tor`

When you install the first package from the EPEL repository you will be asked about verifying the EPEL GPG signing key. Please ensure the key matches with the one available on the [Fedora Project website](https://getfedora.org/keys/).

# 4. Configure `/etc/tor/torrc`

This is a very simple version of the `torrc` configuration file in order to run a Middle/Guard relay on the Tor network:

```
Nickname    myNiceRelay   # Change the nickname "myNiceRelay" to a name that you like
ORPort      9001
SocksPort   0
ExitRelay   0
ContactInfo your@email    # Please write your email address and be aware that it will be published
```

# 5. Enable and start your Tor relay

CentOS 7 / RHEL 7:

```
systemctl enable tor
systemctl start tor
```

CentOS 6 / RHEL 6:

```
service tor enable
service tor start
```

# 6. Final notes

If you are having troubles setting up your relay, have a look at our [help section](/relay/getting-help/). If your relay is now running, check out the [post-install](/relay/setup/post-install/) notes.
